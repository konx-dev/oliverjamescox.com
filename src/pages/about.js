          Work extensively across the Adobe CC product range on a daily basis. Illustrator is my goto for anything vector based; such as svg icons, also for any illustration work I do. Photoshop for anything pixel based. InDesign I use alot at work creating print collateral and digital assets. After Effects is something I use on occasions for motion graphics and looking to incorporate it more in future projects with the viability and industries interest in animation.<br></br><br></br>My goto for prototyping / wireframing is Figma, I have experimented with alternatives but found this to tick the most boxes. The ability to share my designs and recieve instant feedback along with it being accessible across mac and windows has really streamlined my design process.
